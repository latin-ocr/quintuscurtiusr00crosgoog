’ opinion “ standain some measure in contradictiontowhat was said
above; namely,thstmexande1²s return was called forth only hy
Parmenio’e message. Herc he forms the resolution spontaneously.”
Now we perceive no such contradiction, nor, we thinhwill a correct
understanding ol the context justify such a conclusion' eur author
states that the king proceeded a considerable distance (multrare oie)
in the pureuit, when messengcrs from Parmenio arrived informing
him, that thet general was hard pressed on the left wing. Alexan· ι
