4 Bellula-An American will hardly read this description with·
ont calling to mind the sea serpent so nmous in the neighbourhood
ol Boston.

b Most-li the remark ol the Delphin editor on the word obripu-
oo, a little below, be well founded, nnmely, Neptunum sie molem ἐκ
preceps dotorum, quomodo cetum repmseqaersmr, then we think the
reading here should be emerit, “he plunged into the deep‚” signir'y-
ing to the lysiam, that thus would the mole, appearing to them
like some huge animal, sinlr into the wsters

t Deam-mis word, literelly signilying “gliding in different

isere, mutually seperate when relieved from those doubts and leons.
'l. Primo e Macedonum, dte-“The first ol the Macedonian vessels

that esme up was a quinquereme, distinguished above the rest ior ¹

its speed.”

ἃ It' dinem* From opposite directions” 'lhe idea eonveyed by
the whole eontext is this: When the quinquereme found herself .
sttaelred ou both sides, she turned suddenly around upon one ot her '
adreisaries, but, beiore she eould get sor enough'sround to bring her

’ own beelr to bear upon the side ol her antagonist, end while in the
set ol turning, she exposed her side to the bealr ol her opponent,
whioh was loroed in so lar es to unite the two vessels together.

t. Excuteretsr e puppe—Any one who has seen the representations
of eneient vessels ean easily understand, how mueh the pilots were
exposed to accidente, like theone here mentioned. The unhappy
iste oi Palinurus (AEneid v. ,⁸57) must oeeur to the reader.
